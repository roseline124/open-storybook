üìñ Focused Storybook
Focused Storybook is a VSCode extension that helps developers run Storybook with only the currently focused story file, significantly speeding up Storybook startup times ‚Äî especially in large monorepos.

üöÄ Features

Automatically detects the nearest .storybook/main.ts (or main.js).
Temporarily overrides the stories array to include only the currently active story file.
Runs npm run storybook dev -p 6006 directly from the correct project directory.
Automatically restores the original main.ts/main.js when Storybook shuts down.
Supports multiple concurrent Storybook sessions ‚Äî each with its own isolated config and backup.

üéØ Why Use Focused Storybook?

Working with large Storybook projects can be slow, especially when all stories across a monorepo or large project need to be loaded.
Focused Storybook lets you:

Test a single story in isolation.
Avoid loading hundreds of unnecessary stories.
Quickly debug a specific component's story.
Run multiple Storybook instances for different components simultaneously.

üìÇ How It Works

Open any \*.stories.tsx (or .js, .jsx, .mdx) file.

Run the command:
Open Focused Storybook from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).

The extension:
Locates the nearest .storybook/main.ts (or .storybook/main.js).
Creates a backup of the original config.
Replaces the stories array to load only the current file.
Starts Storybook.
Restores the original main.ts/main.js when Storybook exits.

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Node.js 18+ (recommended)
Storybook installed locally in the project (no global dependency required)
Works with both JavaScript and TypeScript Storybook configurations

üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

This extension assumes:

Storybook can be started with:

```
npm run storybook dev -p 6006
```

.storybook directory is present at the project root or in the nearest ancestor folder.
If you use a different command (yarn, pnpm), you can customize the command in future versions.

üîí Safety

Each Storybook session gets its own backup file, so multiple sessions can run in parallel safely.
If the editor crashes, you can manually restore the backup using the command:
Restore Storybook Config

üì∏ Example
Example project structure:

```
apps/
    design-system/
        .storybook/
            main.ts
        src/
            components/
                Button/
                    Button.stories.tsx
```

When you open Button.stories.tsx and run Open Focused Storybook, only that file loads.

üèóÔ∏è Supported Storybook Versions

Supports both Next.js and standard React setups
